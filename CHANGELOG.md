## [1.20.0] - 2023-11-30
### Changed
### Added
- REST: Added map copy, align and stitch requests
- REST: Added device model logging to improve future localization method development
- Core: Added configurable `solverType` to enable localization method selection
- Core: Added new map construction parameters:
  - `locFilter`, disabled by default
  - `featureFilter`, 0 by default
  - `mapCompression`, 0 by default
### Fixed
- Core: Android plugin; user validation (for real-time mapping and other Enterprise features)

## [1.19.2] - 2023-10-03
### Changed
- Unity to 2022.3.10f1
- Updated Unity packages
- Core: Updated plugin interface for `LocalizeImage()`, now returns a struct with the pose data and confidence value
- Samples: Now use `TrackedPoseDriver` in favour of the deprecated `ARPoseDriver`
### Added
- Core: Added native plugins for Magic Leap 2 and HoloLens 2
- Developer Portal: Password reset functionality
### Fixed
- Core: On-server localization now works when the map construction has reached the `sparse` state

### Fixed
- Core: Map construction would sometimes fail with a dataset that worked with 1.18.1

Skipped rendering frame because GfxDevice is in invalid state (device lost)". Deleting the Library folder in the Unity project seems to fix this. This problem is related to Unity 2022 and AR Foundation.

## [1.12.0] - 2021-03-31
### Changed
- SDK uses `mapId` everywhere instead of `mapHandle`
- Cloud Service: Map alignment stored in the new metadata as a Vector3(tx, ty, tz) and Quaternion(qw, qx, qy, qz). Old ecef endpoint will be deprecated later

### Added
- Cloud Service: New map metadata stored with all new maps
- Cloud Service: New REST API endpoints to get and set metadata and reset map alignment in metadata
- Cloud Service: New Align Maps feature aligns maps and updates their metadata. Similar to stitching maps but with no new map as output
- Cloud Service: Coverage .json log file for map stiching and alignment jobs
- Core: New pointcloudDisk shader with adjustable point size and 2D/3D modes
- Core: Added a helper function `LoadAndInstantiateARMap()` in `ARSpace` for easier runtime map initialization
- Core: `LoadMapAsync()` now fetches the map metadata
- Core: `ARMap` functionality to load/save/reset map alignment metadata
- Core: New `AR Map Downloader` tool to automatically download and set up maps in scenes

It is still an experimental feature and can be tested setting `m_UseGeoPose` to `true` in `MapperBase` (and switching to the on-server localizer in Mapper). This feature will be better supported in the upcoming v1.12 SDK release.

## [1.4.1] - 2020-04-17 (INTERNAL)
### Added
- MD5 hashing of map files

### Changed

## [1.4.0] - 2020-04-07 (INTERNAL)
### Added
- SDK and samples now support Huawei AR Engine SDK as an alternative to AR Foundation (not included, can be downloaded [here](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/en/ar).
- `ARLocalizer.cs`: Toggle to reset localizer filtering when the last localized map ID changes -- might be useful in a multimap scenario, where maps are not aligned to each other on purpose.
- `ARLocalizer.cs`: Made `lastLocalizedMapId` public.
- Graph-based navigation example, initial version.

### Fixed
- Android now properly requests for location (GPS) permissions.

### Changed
- Generated maps are now 80% smaller.
- The native plugins are now 75% smaller.
- Both the localization accuracy and speed have been improved.

## [1.3] - 2020-02-07
### Added
- Plugin, Server, Mapper sample: GPS support. When the GPS toggle is on, the list of maps will be populated only by maps generated within a 200 meter radius. When mapping (taking pictures), the latitude/longitude/altitude is saved with the image and used to create a geopose for the constructed map. Also, the on-server localizer accepts lat/lon as parameters for faster retrieval of the map to relocalize against to.
- Plugin, Server, Mapper sample: Visual GPS (VGPS) / geopose support. If geopose data is saved with the map, the localize functions will return the device's geolocation (GPS latitude/longitude/altitude coordinates). This is approximately 10.000 times faster than satellite-based GPS, more accurate, and works indoors! As an added benefit, there is no need to have Location Services enabled. Geopose (geolocation with orientation) can also be calculated.
- On-server localizer now accepts RGB24 images, too. Might be useful with Web AR / headsets, if an 8-bit grayscale PNG is not available or is too costly to generate.
- Developer Portal and Mapper sample: Added support for a 'sparse' processing state. Generated maps are downloadable as `.bytes` and `sparse.ply` files at this point and relocalization is possible. The `dense.ply` will be generated in the background and will be available on the Developer Portal when the processing state is "done". This will speed up the map generation a lot!
- Increased the accuracy of dense map point cloud files.

### Fixed
- `ARLocalizer.cs`: "Burst mode" is now also run when the app enters foreground.
- `ARLocalizer.cs` and `ARHelper.cs`: Fixed rotation for different screen orientations, so you can publish in portrait/landscape/auto.
- Plugin: Localizer returns -1 handle if no maps are loaded.

### Changed
- Renamed Immersal AR Cloud SDK to just Immersal SDK.
- Samples: Updated project to Unity 2019.2.20f1.
- Samples: Added dependency to AR Foundation 3.0.1.
- Changed `mapHandle` in the core and samples scripts to `mapId`, as the localizer now returns the real database ID for the map (if available).
- Map format: Maps generated with the SDK v1.3 are not compatible with earlier versions of the SDK. However, maps generated with older versions continue to work with v1.3.

## [1.2] - 2019-10-16
### Added
- Developer Portal: Map stitching; you can select multiple maps and combine them into one new map (assuming the maps have overlapping features).
- Samples: Mapping App; continue updating older maps by restoring the map source data.
- Samples: Mapping App; you can now delete maps in the app.
- SDK: Mapping performance improvements.
- SDK: REST API updated and cleaned up.

### Fixed
- Samples: The "AR Cloud space" rotation and position can now be get from `ARSpace.cs` instead of `ARLocalizer.cs`, which was buggy anyway and returned only the first map's pose, thus giving incorrect results when using multimaps.
- Samples: Navigation and multiplayer samples fixed to work with multimaps.
- Samples: UI fixes

### Changed
- Samples: Updated project to Unity 2019.2.8f1 and AR Foundation 3.0.0 preview.3, should continue to work just fine with older versions.
